Selenium provides various methods to find an element on a webpage. These methods are known as location strategies. The following methods from the selenium driver class are used to find elements:
find_element: finds a single element from a webpage or parent element.
find_elements: finds multiple elements from a webpage or parent element.

To find element by ID, ClassName and Name, Tag name, CSS Selector, XPATH,LINK_TEXT and PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT: execute the command:
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
To find by ID: driver.find_element(By.ID, "element_id")
To find by NAME: driver.find_element(By.NAME, "element_name")
To find by CLASS NAME: driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "element_classname")       #class is referred to as class name in python when finding elements
                      driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "element_classname")
To find by TAG NAME: driver.find_element(By.ID, "TAG_NAME")
To find by CLASS CSS SELECTOR: driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "element_css_selector")
                      driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "element_css_selector")
To find by XPATH: driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "element_xpath")
Example:
form = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//form[1]")
To find by LINK TEXT: driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "link text")
To find by PARTIAL LINK TEXT: driver.find_element(By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT, "partial link text")

ACTIONCHAINS
ActionChains are a way to automate low level interactions such as mouse movement, mouse button action,
key press and context menu interaction. Unlike web element which provides just two interactions which
are send_keys and click events, ActionChains provide almost all possible interactions and events you
can perform on an element and on a webpage. example of events you can perform with ActionChains include:
Right click event
element dragging
copy and paste events
scrolling
etc

To perform the above actions using ActionChains the following package needs to be imported:
from selenium.webdriver import ActionChains
Then the ActionChains object needs to be initialized with the WebDriver object.
action = ActionChains(driver)
